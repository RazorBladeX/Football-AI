# Football-AI

A desktop dashboard that tracks football matches across English leagues, stores them locally, and generates AI-powered predictions.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies (Python 3.12+ recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```

The app will create a local SQLite database (`football_ai.db`), fetch today's fixtures, and start background live updates.
